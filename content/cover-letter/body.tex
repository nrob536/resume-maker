I am writing to express my interest in the \textbf{Design Analyst} position (Reference {\#}: 15869) at Tatauranga Aotearoa - Stats NZ. Over the past two years in the public service, I have successfully delivered innovative data analytics solutions, led capability building across teams, and contributed to high-profile statistical products. Examples of this are the \textbf{Employment Stocks and Flows} (ESF) series and the \textbf{New Zealand Activity Index} (NZAC). These experiences have strengthened my expertise in economic data pipelines.

As a Kaitātari Hoahoa | Design Analyst at Stats NZ, I have:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Collaborated on the ESF and NZAC pipelines, optimising R-based workflows and implementing quality assurance processes that improved efficiency and reduced manual intervention.
    \item Developed and maintained reusable R packages and automated dashboards, lifting capability across Stats NZ’s analytical community and reducing duplicated effort across teams.
    \item Mentored analysts in R, Git workflows, and reproducible practices, fostering a culture of knowledge-sharing and helping new staff rapidly upskill.
    \item Supported enterprise-wide data products like \textbf{Nga Tūtohu Aotearoa – Indicators Aotearoa New Zealand} and the \textbf{COVID-19 Data Portal}, ensuring high-quality, transparent statistical outputs.
\end{itemize}

\noindent These achievements demonstrate that I can provide expert advice, champion methodological improvements, and build capability across the data ecosystem. I am committed to continue delivering innovative, high-quality design solutions for Stats NZ.

\noindent My approach to leadership and collaboration is guided by the whakataukī \textbf{“He waka eke noa”} — we are all in this together. This principle shapes how I work, mentor, and contribute to the public service: fostering unity, shared responsibility, and a culture where we collectively navigate challenges and succeed together.

\noindent I welcome the opportunity to bring my experience, values, and results-driven mindset to this role and help strengthen Stats NZ’s analytical capability.
